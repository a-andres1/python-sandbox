# Chapter 2: Variables, Expressions, and Statements 

## The building blocks of Python: Constants, Reserved words, and Variables

- Constants: fixed values
    - numbers/letters/strings (" or ')
- Reserved words
    - very similar to JS words
- Variables: named place in the memore where we store data and retrieve it later
    - variable data is...variable! meaning you can change it later with additional statements

### Variable name rules in Python
- Must start w/letter or underscore_
- Must consist of letters, numbers, and underscores
- Case sensitive (spam, Spam, and SPAM are all different but why would you do that to yourself?)

### Variable "Best Practices" 
- use variable names to help you remember what you're referring to. 

## Assignment statement
- it's the (=) sign. (=) means "assign this to something. 
- "arrow nature"  x = do this first OR x -> things over here will be computed THEN (x) will be changed

```
{
    <!-- start here -->
    x = 0.6
    <!-- have python run this -->
    x = 3.9 * x * ( 1 - x)
    <!-- this should be the output -->
    x = 0.936
}
```
