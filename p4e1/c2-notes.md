# Chapter 2

## The building blocks of Python: Constants, Reserved words, and Variables

- Constants: fixed values
    - numbers/letters/strings (" or ')
- Reserved words
    - very similar to JS words
- Variables: named place in the memore where we store data and retrieve it later
    - variable data is...variable! meaning you can change it later with additional statements
